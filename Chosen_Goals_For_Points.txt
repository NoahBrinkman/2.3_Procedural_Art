A clear description of architectural elements is given. 1 Point = 1/9

A clear description of the city shape is given
(roads, neighbourhoods, terrain elements, top-down-
structure)								  1 point = 2/9

A clear description of materials is given (necessary
amount, state of material, material properties). 	  1 point = 3/9

New procedural techniques or tools have been
researched and described (“new” = not treated in
detail during the labtures)					  1 point  = 4/9

A wide range of shapes is created procedurally from
a smaller range of building blocks. 			  1 point = 5/9

Meshes are created or modified procedurally (e.g.
lathe, extrude, warp). 	(roads)			 	  1 point = 6/9 points(nice)

The resulting structures match the visual research. (create what you planned)     
									  1 point = 7/9 points

A consistent scale for size and placement of
buildings and other structures has been established. 	  1 point = 8/9


Building parameters can be controlled before
generation (e.g., different neighbourhoods have
different building styles)					   1 point = 9/9



Appropriate lighting and Post Processing / VFX have
been applied to enhance visual fidelity. 			   1 point = 10/9
